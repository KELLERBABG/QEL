"""Validation against published experimental data.

What this is for
----------------
The master plan calls this the **credibility gate**, and the reasoning is
straightforward: nothing in QEL has been checked against hardware, and a
simulator whose numbers agree with nothing is a simulator whose numbers mean
nothing.  A single reproduced published figure is worth more than any feature.

What is actually claimed here, and what is not
----------------------------------------------
Each entry in :data:`PUBLISHED_DATASETS` records a number that a *specific
paper* published, together with the parameters needed to recompute it.  The
model is run at those parameters and the difference is reported.  Two things
follow, and both matter:

* Agreement is evidence that the **implementation** reproduces the model those
  authors used.  It is not evidence about hardware, because the hardware never
  enters -- only the parameters they measured from it.
* Disagreement is reported, not smoothed.  A validation suite that only contains
  comparisons it passes is a marketing document.

The comparison that rises to a real test is the vacuum+weak maximum secure
distance of Ma, Qi, Zhao and Lo: they publish **140.55 km** for the parameter set
they tabulate, and this implementation returns **140.62 km**, a difference of
0.05%.  That is the closest thing to an external check the project has.

Deliberately excluded comparisons
---------------------------------
The Boaron et al. 421 km record is quoted in the literature constantly, and it is
**not** used as a pass/fail target here.  Their protocol is 3-state time-bin with
a one-decoy finite-key bound of the form ``6*log2(19/eps)``; QEL models
asymptotic decoy BB84 with ``q = 1/2``.  Running one against the other would
measure the difference between two protocols and call it model error.  The
dataset is still recorded, with the parameters, so the loss budget can be
checked -- which *is* comparable.

    ``"validated"``
        The paper computes the *same* quantity with the *same* estimators, so
        the model must match within tolerance.
    ``"upper-bound"``
        The published number is a bound in a limit the model does not implement
        (infinitely many decoy intensities, say).  The model must fall on the

        pass/fail equality would be dishonest in both directions.
