"""Asynchronous discrete-event simulation kernel.

This is the simulation **kernel**, not a helper.  Everything that changes state
over time should go through it, so that ordering questions -- "did the photon
arrive before the memory expired?" -- have a defined answer at the resolution
where they are asked.

Time unit and precision
-----------------------
Time is a float in **seconds** and the kernel imposes no resolution of its own,
so a caller working in microseconds can simply pass microseconds.  That is
deliberate: microsecond causality with a correct ordering guarantee is a step
change over step-based propagation, and it is testable.  Picosecond precision is
not attempted, because sub-nanosecond ordering without a hardware clock to
justify it is precision theatre.

Causality contract
------------------
The kernel guarantees the following, and the test suite enforces each one:

1. **Monotone time.** ``current_time`` never decreases.  Events execute in
   non-decreasing order of their scheduled time.
2. **Deterministic ties.** Events at equal time execute in insertion order, so
   a simulation is reproducible from the same schedule.  (Handlers that consume
   randomness are reproducible only if their RNG is seeded -- the kernel does
   not manage randomness.)
3. **No scheduling into the past.** Once execution has begun, scheduling an
   event before ``current_time`` would make cause and effect observably
   inconsistent, so it raises :class:`MoveToPastError`.  Before the first event
   runs, any time is allowed, because negative offsets are the natural way to
   express "already in flight" initial conditions.

The third rule is the one that earns its keep.  A step-based simulation cannot
express it at all, and an event kernel that does not enforce it will happily
produce a plausible-looking timeline in which a swap completes before its input
pair was created.

    ``@dataclass(order=True)`` with ``compare=False`` on the payload fields
    looks right but is not: the generated comparison still falls through to
    tuple comparison of the *remaining* fields, so ``heapq`` will order
    equal-time events by ``kind`` and ``node_id`` (i.e. alphabetically by node
    name) instead of by insertion.  That is a silent reproducibility bug, and
