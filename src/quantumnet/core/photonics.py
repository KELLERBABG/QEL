"""Photonic hardware layer: detectors, Bell-state measurement, and time multiplexing.

What this adds
--------------
Until now the physical layer mapped distance to a *depolarizing probability* and
stopped.  Detector efficiency, dark counts, dead time, timing jitter and
multiplexing were either absent or collapsed into a single number in
``graph.QuantumLink``.  That is enough to rank routes, and not enough to predict
a generation *rate* or a *success probability* -- which is the difference between
a result that can be compared to an experiment and one that cannot.

Barrett-Kok
-----------
The double-heralded generation scheme of Barrett and Kok, Phys. Rev. A **71**,
060310(R) (2005), [arXiv:quant-ph/0408040](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0408040).
Two memories are excited, the photons interfere on a 50:50 beam splitter, and
success is heralded by a coincidence.  Everything in the module follows from two
published facts about that scheme:

* **The ideal success probability is 1/2**, and the paper states that as the
  protocol's theoretical upper limit.  It is not a choice of parameters.
* **The probability is quadratic in detector efficiency** ("p has a quadratic
  dependence on eta").  Two photons must each survive and each be detected, so
  ``p ∝ eta_det^2``.

Loss therefore costs *rate*, not *fidelity*: a lost photon is a failed attempt,
not a corrupted pair.  That property is why Barrett-Kok is worth modelling
separately from a depolarizing channel, which conflates the two.

What degrades fidelity instead, and what this module models
-----------------------------------------------------------
* **Dark counts.**  A coincidence caused by two dark counts is
  indistinguishable from a real herald, so it contributes a maximally mixed
  pair.  This enters as an explicit mixture, which is why ``p_success`` and
  ``raw_fidelity`` are computed together rather than sequentially.
* **Mode mismatch.**  Frequency/polarisation/spatio-temporal mismatch reduces
  the heralded fidelity directly.
* **Memory decoherence** during the attempt, charged through
  :func:`~quantumnet.core.physical.bell_pair_fidelity_after_dt`.

Dead time and jitter are modelled as detector properties and applied to the
rate, not the per-attempt probability -- they make a detector unavailable for a
while, which is a scheduling fact, not a physics one.

    exactly the 1/2.
