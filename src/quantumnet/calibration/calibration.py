"""Calibrate the decoy-state model against a published dataset.

The plan's P2.5 asks for one published fibre key-rate dataset reproduced, with the
comparison published. This is that reproduction, and it is deliberately written so the
disagreements are as visible as the agreements.

The dataset

Lo, Ma & Chen, *Decoy State Quantum Key Distribution*, Phys. Rev. Lett. **94**, 230504
(2005), [arXiv:quant-ph/0411004](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411004), Figure 1. It
computes the secure key rate for the experimental parameters of Gobby, Yuan & Shields,
Appl. Phys. Lett. **84**, 3762 (2004) -- the same hardware this package's
`gobby-yuan-shields` preset carries -- and reports four checkable statements:

===================  ==========================================================
quantity             published
===================  ==========================================================
optimal signal mu    "roughly 0.5", of order ``O(1)`` rather than ``O(eta)``
reach with decoys    "over 140 km"
reach without them   "only about 30 km" (prior-art GLLP)
upper bound          "208 km", where ``e_1 = 1/4`` and intercept-resend wins
===================  ==========================================================

**Why the reach is the interesting one.** The paper's own framing is that decoy states
raise the net rate from ``O(eta^2)`` to ``O(eta)``; the reach is the consequence. So a
model that gets the *optimal intensity* right is capturing the mechanism, and a model that
then falls short on *reach* is making a conservative choice somewhere specific -- which is
worth locating rather than quoting.

**Where this package deliberately differs.** `max_secure_distance_km` reports the reach at
which the **finite-key** secret length is positive, using the LCWX bound, and its
single-photon yield is bounded conservatively rather than with the paper's
infinite-decoy limit. Both make it *more* pessimistic than Figure 1, which is drawn
asymptotically. That is the right trade for a package that refuses to quote a key length
it cannot justify, but it means agreement on the absolute reach is not expected and
should not be manufactured by loosening the bound.
