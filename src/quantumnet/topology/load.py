"""Load and the classical control plane -- making *throughput* a defined quantity.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
Every rate this package reports so far is unconditional: "a link at this distance
yields this key rate", "a reservation that is granted costs this much fidelity". Those
are properties of a *single* request. Throughput is not. It is only defined against a
**request stream** -- how often demands arrive, and what happens when two want the same
memory at once. With one request, "throughput" is undefined, and reporting a number
anyway is the kind of unfalsifiable claim this package tries not to make.

So the acceptance test for this milestone is deliberately negative:

    **with no load, throughput is undefined; with a request stream, it becomes
    defined and is bounded above by both the arrival rate and the service rate.**

That bound is what makes the number meaningful. A measured throughput above the arrival
rate means the accounting is wrong, not that the network is fast.

Two pieces
----------
1. :class:`RequestGenerator` -- arrivals as a Poisson process, so the stream is
   reproducible from a seed and its statistics are checkable (inter-arrival times are
   exponential with mean ``1/rate``; the count in a fixed window is Poisson).
2. :class:`ClassicalControlPlane` -- messages between nodes with a configurable
   propagation delay, **counted**, because classical coordination is a real cost in a
   quantum network and an uncounted one is invisible in the results.

Nothing here re-implements contention: :class:`ResourceManager` already arbitrates, and
this layer feeds it and counts what comes out.
