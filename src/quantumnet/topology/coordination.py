"""Segment-aware classical coordination, against the whole-span bound.

The shipped model charges every swap a round trip across the **whole chain**:

    coordination = (n_links - 1) * round_trip(span)

That is O(N^2) in the number of links.  But a swap only fuses **two adjacent
segments**, and the coordination for it has to reach the outer endpoints of just
those two.  Charging the whole chain for every fusion overstates the delay, and the
overstatement grows with chain length -- so it is worst exactly where latency
matters most.

This module computes the honest figure for a given fusion order and reports the
ratio, which decides whether the shipped bound is a minor conservatism or a
material distortion.
