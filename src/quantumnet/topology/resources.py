"""Resource management: reservations, contention, and the rules that arbitrate.

Why this exists
---------------
A memory array with states is necessary but not sufficient.  The question that
makes a network a network is *who gets the memory when two demands want it*,
and that question has no answer without an allocator and a policy.  This module
is that answer, and it is the piece the master plan identifies as the largest
conceptual gap against the incumbent simulator.

The shape, following SeQUeNCe's design
--------------------------------------
``Reservation``
    A request: initiator, responder, a start and end time, how many memory
    pairs, and a target fidelity.  It has a lifecycle and ends in exactly one
    of: rejected, expired, fulfilled, released.
``ResourceManager``
    Owns a node's memory array.  Accepts or refuses reservations, allocates
    memories, releases them on expiry or completion, and refuses to
    double-allocate.
``resolve_contention``
    The arbitration policy when the array cannot satisfy every pending
    reservation.  Higher priority first; FIFO within a priority band.  The
    tie-break is explicit because an implicit one (dict order, allocation order)
    makes results irreproducible -- the same failure the event kernel had.
``NodeEntanglementManager``
    Two nodes negotiating: a request is only granted if **both** ends can supply
    memories, which is what produces genuine contention rather than two
    independent per-node decisions.

The acceptance test this is built for
-------------------------------------
Two competing requests contend and exactly one is refused.  That is the M3
criterion in the master plan, and it is a *different* question from "does
allocation work" -- a manager that grants both requests has no contention at
all, and would make every multi-user network result wrong in the optimistic
direction.
