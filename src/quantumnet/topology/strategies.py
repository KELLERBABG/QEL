"""Pluggable routing strategies.

Why an interface rather than a function
---------------------------------------
QEL already had two good routers -- an exhaustive fidelity ranking and a
Dijkstra -- but they were free functions with different call shapes and no way
to say *which* policy a result came from.  That matters for two reasons:

1. **A comparison needs a control.**  "QEL routes better than a general-purpose
   simulator" is only meaningful against that simulator's actual policy.  The
   incumbent's stock static routing is Dijkstra on **physical distance**, so
   that policy is implemented here as :class:`LengthRouting` -- not to use it,
   but so it can be beaten *measurably* rather than rhetorically.
2. **Strategies must be substitutable.**  A planner should be able to swap the
   policy without editing the caller, and a third party should be able to add
   one without touching this file -- which is what the registry provides.

The strategies
--------------
:class:`FidelityOptimalRouting`
    Dijkstra on ``-log W`` where ``W = (4F-1)/3``.  Provably optimal for
    end-to-end fidelity, because the Werner parameter is exactly multiplicative
    under swapping and therefore ``-log W`` is exactly additive along a path.
    This is QEL's differentiator and it is the default.
:class:`LengthRouting`
    Dijkstra on physical distance, matching the incumbent's stock policy.
    The control condition.
:class:`HopCountRouting`
    Fewest links.  Included because it is the obvious naive choice, and because
    on a loss-heavy network it is *not* the same as the fidelity-optimal route.
:class:`StaticRouting`
    A hand-configured forwarding table, for reproducing a fixed deployment.

All of them return a :class:`~quantumnet.topology.routing.Route`, so nothing
downstream needs to know which policy produced it.
