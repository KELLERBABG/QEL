"""Standard data-centre topologies as first-class objects.

Why these two
-------------
`ring` and `grid` already existed, which covers metro and mesh geometry.  FatTree
and BCube cover the shapes a *data-centre* quantum network takes, and they matter
for a specific reason: they are deliberately built with **different path
redundancy at different levels**, so they separate routing policies that a grid
cannot.  On a symmetric grid every sensible policy picks nearly the same route;
on a FatTree the distance-minimising and fidelity-minimising routes genuinely
diverge, which is exactly the comparison the master plan needs to make.

Both are defined in their standard form:

* **FatTree(k)** -- *k* pods, each with *k*/2 aggregation and *k*/2 edge
  switches, and (*k*/2)^2 core switches.  Every host connects to one edge switch.
  Hosts in the same pod share a short path; across pods the path goes up to a
  core and back down.
* **BCube(n, k)** -- *n*-port switches at each of *k+1* levels, with *n^(k+1)*
  hosts.  Level *j* connects hosts differing in digit *j* of their base-*n*
  address.  Adding a level adds redundancy rather than length, so BCube
  degrades more gracefully than FatTree.

Both are built in pure Python, keeping the project's no-dependency promise.
NetworkX interop is deliberately *not* added: it would be a heavyweight
dependency for a convenience, and the canonical `QuantumTopology` shape is
already the interface every consumer uses.
