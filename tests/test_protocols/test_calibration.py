"""Calibration against a published decoy-state dataset.

The dataset is Lo, Ma & Chen, Phys. Rev. Lett. **94**, 230504 (2005),
[arXiv:quant-ph/0411004](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0411004), Figure 1, computed for
the Gobby-Yuan-Shields hardware this package's `gobby-yuan-shields` preset carries.

These tests pin three things:

* the statements the package **does** reproduce, so a regression is caught;
* the statements it **does not**, so a later change cannot silently make them agree by
  loosening a bound -- a calibration that quietly moved the goalposts would be worse than
  none;
* the **mechanism**, which is the part that matters more than any single number. The
  source's central claim is that the optimal signal intensity sits at ``mu = O(1)`` rather
  than ``O(eta)``, and that is what raises the rate from ``O(eta^2)`` to ``O(eta)``.
  Reproducing that is evidence the model captures the physics; matching an absolute reach
  drawn asymptotically is not something a finite-key package should be tuned to do.
