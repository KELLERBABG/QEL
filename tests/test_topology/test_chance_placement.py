"""Chance-constrained repeater placement over a continuous coherence prior.

This is the item the master plan calls the genuinely open gap (P3.2). The tests pin the
properties the construction depends on, because the reduction from a probability
statement to a deterministic one is only valid if they hold:

* **monotonicity** -- better coherence never makes a chain worse, which is the premise
  that lets a probabilistic requirement be checked at a quantile at all;
* **the quantile direction** -- a tighter reliability target must use a *more demanding*
  scenario, and must never produce a better rate;
* **the correlated/independent distinction** -- declared rather than guessed, because the
  two cases genuinely differ and the reduction is conservative, not exact.

The coherence times are set in the **sensitive regime**. At T1 ~ 100 s the model's
fidelity saturates (0.970398 for T1 anywhere from 10 s to 200 s) and every test would
pass while proving nothing; the answer only moves between roughly 1e-4 s and 1e-2 s.
