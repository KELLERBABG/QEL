"""The logical key rate: the package's distinctive number.

"Key rate after error correction" is a figure almost nobody reports, so it is worth
being pedantic about. These tests pin the parts that are easy to get subtly wrong:

* the **Werner composition** of two error sources, which an earlier version got wrong
  by treating a bit-flip probability as a fidelity (overstating logical fidelity by
  0.004 at the package's own operating point, and by up to 0.09 at lower physical
  fidelity);
* the **rounds conversion**, where a bit flip needs ``1 - 2p`` rather than ``1 - p``
  because a flip has two outcomes;
* and the **monotonicity properties** that any defensible key rate must satisfy --
  correction cannot improve the pair, and more rounds cannot help.
