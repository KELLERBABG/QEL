"""Rotated surface code: what is verified, and what is deliberately not.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
The master plan's guardrail is *never quote a threshold or logical-error-rate
number that has not been both cited and reproduced locally*.  The same applies
to the syndrome-extraction circuit, for a sharper reason: a wrong CNOT ordering
does not raise.  It still runs, still returns syndromes, and still produces a
"logical error rate" -- that number is simply wrong, and it looks plausible.

So this file records only claims that were checked against an authoritative
oracle, and states plainly what remains open.

VERIFIED HERE (against ``stim``'s rotated-surface-code generator)
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Qubit counts: ``d^2`` data, ``d^2 - 1`` measure, ``2 d^2 - 1`` total.
2. Data qubits occupy the (odd, odd) coordinate sublattice: a ``d x d`` grid
   with spacing 2.
3. The ancillas split evenly into X-type and Z-type, and they are disjoint.
4. Every CNOT in the round is ancilla<->data -- never data<->data and never
   ancilla<->ancilla.  X-type ancillas act as CNOT *controls*, Z-type as
   *targets*.
5. Stabilizer weights are only ever 2 or 4: weight 2 on the boundary,
   weight 4 in the bulk.
6. **The reference circuit's circuit-level fault distance equals ``d``.**  This
   is the ground truth any implementation must reproduce, and the number a
   hook-prone ordering would silently halve.

NOT VERIFIED HERE -- do not assume these
----------------------------------------
* **The stabilizer supports and their pairwise commutation.**  Two geometric
  guesses were tried and *both provably wrong*: a Chebyshev-distance rule and a
  Manhattan-distance-2 rule each leave same-type stabilizers anticommuting,
  which is impossible for a valid code and therefore proves the guess bad
  rather than proving the code bad.  The correct support must be read out of
  stim's detector definitions (or its detector error model), not inferred from
  coordinates.  Until that is done, no stabilizer table in this repository
  should be trusted.

* **A generative rule for the CNOT ordering.**  ``stim`` emits a
  hook-avoiding order, but it is *not* the folklore "X-type gets one shape,
  Z-type the other": X-type ancillas at different coordinates take different
  orderings (asserted below).  A candidate rule exists in the literature and in
  ``rotated_surface_code_spec.md``, but it **contradicts** the order this
  repository extracted from stim, so neither should be committed to code until
  one is reconciled against the fault-distance oracle.

``stim`` is a **verification-only** tool.  It is not a QEL dependency, and this
module skips cleanly when it is absent.
